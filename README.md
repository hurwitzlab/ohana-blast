# Dependencies

Ohana BLAST needs a Python 3 virtual environment called 'mublast'. The file requirements.txt lists the packages that
must be installed in 'mublast'. Using conda the virtual environment can be created this way:

```
$ conda create -n mublast --file requirements.txt
```

Alternatively pip may be used once the 'mublast' virtual environment has been created:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
